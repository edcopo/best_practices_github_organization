### Structuring Your Educational Code Porting Project (edcupo)

1. **Project Overview:**
   - Write a clear mission statement that outlines edcupo's goals and its educational focus.

2. **Core Components:**
   - **Code Inspection:**
     - Develop a module to parse codebases and extract metadata.
   - **Visualization:**
     - Use libraries (e.g., Graphviz) to visualize relationships and design patterns.
   - **Porting Mechanism:**
     - Create a modular architecture that allows for easy adaptation of code to Rust.

3. **Content Creation:**
   - Document the learning process, challenges faced, and solutions found during development.

4. **Integration with LLMs:**
   - Design interfaces for integrating large language models to assist in code documentation and porting automation.

5. **User Interface:**
